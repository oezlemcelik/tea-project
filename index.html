    <p>

        China is one of the origins of tea and has a long history of tea production.
        China has the worldâ€™s largest tea plantation area
        and the worldâ€™s largest tea production.
        After thousands of years of evolution, 
        tea has formed six widely recognized
        types of tea in the industry, namely green tea,
        black tea, oolong tea, yellow tea, and white tea.
        Each type of tea has its own suitable picking season,
        special craftsmanship, and distinctive contents.
